# Curing-Cores
A side scroller action rpg game where you kill enemies and learn the story of the game as you progress.

# Character Mechanics
To implement various mechanics for both the player character and the AI characters, the state pattern is utilized. A state base class is implemented for input handling and structuring of the child classes. Every single agent is able to transition to its own special states, although agents in general implement basic mechanics such as movement.
