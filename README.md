## Character Mechanics
To implement various mechanics for both the player character and the AI characters, the state pattern is utilized. A state base class is implemented for input handling and structuring of the child classes. Every single agent is able to transition to its own special states, although agents in general implement basic mechanics such as movement.

## Special Abilites
The main character has 3 special abilites which are: Teleportation, BloodSlash and Lightning hook. These special abilites are integrated to state pattern. Also for outline shader and general ability checks, special ability classes called rings are implemented.
Player has to switch between abilites to perform. This also contributes to character stats of the current ability state. For an example if the character has red outline, it increases damage output both in default attacks and bloodslash skill and same for the other states. The outline shader is the indication for which ability is available to use.

## Pickups
There are 4 types of pickups in the game curing cores. First of them is the health pickup which increases current health point of the character. Rest of the pickups correlate with player ability stats. These stats can be separated as movement(horizontal and jump str), damage output increase, teleportation distance increase.

## Enemies
Enemies are the other agent group that utilizes state pattern. The enemy agents differantiate from player by using detectors to trigger state transition. There are different types of detectors implemented for various range and capability. For patrolling enemies a melee detector and for the skill users a medium range detector and for the shooters a ranged detector is implemented.

## Level Design and Procedural Generation
There are 2 types of levels in the game. One is hand crafted type and the other is procedurally generated. On the hand crafted part the tilemap component with multiple layers is utilized. On the procedural part though, a different approach is implemented.
First from singular blocks a structure prefab is obtained. Then from this prefab a bigger structure(also can be called a cell) is obtained and this process has repeated for creating various cell forms. Finally levels are generated by spawning a random structure prefab from the structure prefab list at the determined position on the map.

## Diaglouge System

This system can separated to 3 modules. First, the configuration on the editor for creating nodes. On this part, a node editor window is created for connecting dialouge data nodes which contain text information as scriptable objects in base dialouge scriptable object. On the second module, after the dialouge data is prepared the related nodes are retrieved from the base dialouge tree progressively based on the player choice. On the third part all that remains is to create a NPC that holds the related dialouge reference which gets activated on player contact.
